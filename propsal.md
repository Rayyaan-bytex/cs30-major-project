# Major Project Proposal

## Description

- For my Major Project, I plan to make a simple Sudoku game in which the user will have to fill a 9 x 9 grid with numbers
- Each column, row, and a 3 x 3 subgrid contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once

## Needs To Have

- An Interactive 9 x 9 Grid     
- Few helper numbers already added in the grid
- Let user select a cell and input a number in it
- Check if user has made a mistake (number added in cell turns red)
- Add a 'Mistakes:' Counter 
- let user delete the number added
- Check if user has completed the level
- Atleast 2 difficulty levels

## Nice To Have

- When user selects a number, highlight every instance of that number in the grid
- When user selects a cell, highlight its row, column, and the 3x3 grid bow it's in
- Let user reveal the answer for the selected level
- Adding a Timer for difficulty (Counter)
- Adding Sound effects

## Taking it to the Next Level
- A System that examines the puzzle and suggests logical moves
