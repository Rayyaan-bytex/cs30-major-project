# Major Project Proposal

## Description

- For my Major Project, I plan to make a simple Sudoku game in which the user will have to fill a 9 x 9 grid with numbers.
- Each column, row, and a 3 x 3 subgrid contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once.

## Needs To Have

- An Interactive 9 x 9 Grid
- Let user input letters in the grid
- Check if user has made a mistake
- Check if user has completed the level
-
